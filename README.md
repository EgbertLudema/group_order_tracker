# group_order_tracker

A new Flutter project.

This app is meant to be able to track group orders you make every now and then, for example ordering snacks for the team every friday.

In the app you can add persons, items and options for items(for example: Fries -> Options: Mayo, Curry, etc.)

Then when you create a new "Group Order", you're able to select a item(option if needed) and a user in your 1st table. The app then generates 2 tables.

The 2nd table shows the order. Only displaying the items ordered and the amount.

The 3th table shows the ordered items per person and the total price so it's easy for you to create a payment request to the team.
